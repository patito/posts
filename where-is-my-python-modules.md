## Where is my python modules?

When we are developing software, it doesn't matter the language, is a common practice
to split the code in small pieces, it helps the legibility and
code organization. In the C language, for example, we create header (\*.h)
files and implementation files (\*.c). In python we have module files with
the extension `.py`. To load a module we use the `import` keyword.
